## Course Description

In a world with ever increasing data generated both by humans and machines alike, the field of computer science has seen a transition from computation-intensive solutions to data-intensive ones. Often in such a scenario, solutions to real-world problems can be derived/learned by analyzing disparate, complex and messy datasets using Data Science methods and approaches.

This course is highly interactive, and will explore the theories, techniques, and the tools necessary to gain insights from such datasets. Using a problem-based learning philosophy, students are expected to make use of such technologies to design data solutions that can process and analyze real-world datasets for a variety of scientific, social, and environmental challenges.

The core topics addressed by the course will be:

- Programming with Data
- Data Mining, Munging, Wrangling
- Statistics, Analytics, Representation, Visualization
- Introduction to Applied Machine-Learning

## Prerequisites
CSC 339 (Programming Languages) OR Programming experience (Instructor Permission Required)

## Required Text
There is no required text for the course. Class slides will be available for download. Suggested textbooks are: 1) Building Machine Learning Systems with Python (Richert and Coelho), 2) Data Science from Scratch (Joel Grus)

## Course Overview
This course is highly interactive and based on the problem-based learning philosophy; students are expected to make use of said technologies to design highly scalable systems that can process and analyze Big Data for a variety of scientific, social, and environmental challenges.

The core topics addressed by the course will be:
* Big-Data and its applications
* Data-Mining and its methods on large data-sets
* Machine-Learning on real world data-sets and its applicability

**Total: 100%**

1. *Class Participation:* Students are expected to keep up with the assigned readings, class assignments, and projects. Every student is expected to participate in class discussions. Many of the class activities will be interactive.
1. *Class / Homework Assignments:* ([Link](https://github.com/UNCG-CSE/Data_Science_17)) Programming based in-class workshops and homework assignments will be given to the students covering the utilization of the tools learned in class. They will be put up on the course website as we progress through the semester. The students have to upload (source code) individual assignments to GitHub.
1. *Final Project:* The final project will be a team based data-science project utilizing available public data sets. In the first week of the course, the students split into teams and will be presented with a set of tentative project ideas to choose from. Novel ideas for projects will be awarded with a 5% bonus grading. After completing each course topic, the teams will have to give a short presentation (3-5 mins) and a report (1 page) of their progress with the project. The projects will be open-source and the teams will have to use GitHub as their code repository. Upon completion of the project the teams will present their software along with the results in form of a presentation (20 minutes) in the class. The teams will also prepare a poster of their project outlining the methodologies, visualizations, and results of their project. The teams will present their posters in a seminar accessible to other students and faculty at the Computer Science and Engineering Department. In addition to the poster presentation, graduate students will have to write a technical paper (minimum 5 pages, template at http://www.ieee.org/documents/trans_jour.docx) on their assigned project.

## Attendance Policy
Attendance is required for all the class meetings and tests. If you will be absent for an exam due to circumstances beyond control, let me know in advance so that we can arrange a make-up test. Students who miss an exam without informing me prior to the exam will receive a 0 on that exam.


## Special Needs and/or Disabilities
Students with disabilities should have documentation from the Office of Accessibility Resources & Services ([Link](https://ods.uncg.edu/)). This documentation should be provided to the instructor for review. In the case of major provisions such as separate testing environment or test-readers, the student must make arrangements with Office of Accessibility Resources & Services so that suitable accommodations can be provided.

## Academic Honesty Policy

The instructor will deal strictly with any violations of academic honesty and integrity in this course. See Academic Integrity Policy ([Link](https://osrr.uncg.edu/academic-integrity/)).  for more details. Any student who violates this policy receives zero point for the work and is subject to a reduction of the final grade of this course (up to "F"). The instructor will report the case to the university.
